Changes at the REALMS (tournament) module of LANsurfer since 1.7.0preview4

- No option 'initialize matches'.
Instead of this option, you should set your tournament to pre-matches state.
You may enter the tourney's round times in the tournament overview.
There are no longer unwritten rules for altering the tourney state except the cancelled state.
- The cancelled state
If you've set your tournament to cancelled state, you can override the script processing by setting any other tourney state.
- seeding
Tourney admins may enter seeding numbers for each player to avoid that good players eliminate other good players in the first rounds.
If there is no seeding entered, the system assumes the highest number plus 1 for that player(s).
If there are some players with the same seeding number, the system uses random ordering within this group.
You find the seeding option at the tourney participants screen.
- blind draw tournaments
In team tournaments you may activate blind draw mode.
Then, single players instead of complete teams register for that tournament,
 for example, up to 1280 players for a Counter-Strike 5on5 tourney with 256 teams.
If you set the blind-draw option, the system constructs the teams after setting the post-draw state.
You may undo this by setting the tourney to a state below post-draw.
- handicap (for blind draw tournaments)
You may use handicaps for tourney players. It's very like the seeding mechanism and could be used to avoid the creation of good teams and bad teams.
- WWCL template for the 5th season
We've added the new WWCL tournament types.
- WWCL XML export
The WWCL XML export will save a lot of time when you're submitting the tourney results to the WWCL.
This module was tested by the WWCL boss Sparky himself, so we recommend to use it instead of the old export.
Look at the export schedule before you start the export.


Bugfixes at the REALMS module
- Double elimination: unfair distribution of free wins
As a result of the implementation of a seeding algorithm, there will be no longer die against die and player against player in the same round.
